Based on my deep analysis, here's a comprehensive breakdown of improvements and new features:

  🎯 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX NOW

  1. Image Storage Crisis

  Problem: Images stored as base64 in Firestore (very expensive, inefficient)
  - Base64 increases size by 33%
  - Firestore charges per GB stored and transferred
  - Will become expensive fast

  Solution: Implement Firebase Storage
  - Store images in Firebase Storage buckets
  - Save only URLs in Firestore
  - Add delete functionality for old images

  2. Dead Navigation Buttons

  Problem: "Map" and "Messages" buttons visible but non-functional
  - Confuses users
  - Looks unfinished

  Options:
  - Remove them completely
  - Implement basic messaging system
  - Add "Coming Soon" labels

  3. Broken Location Picker

  Problem: Shows map but can't click to select location
  - Only text search works
  - No lat/lng capture

  Solution:
  - Add click-to-pin functionality
  - Store coordinates, not just addresses
  - Reverse geocoding for accurate locations

  4. Self-Notifications Bug

  Problem: You get notified when YOU comment on your own posts
  - Line 732-740 in app.js has commented-out fix

  Fix: Uncomment the condition to exclude self
